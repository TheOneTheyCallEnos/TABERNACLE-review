"""
LOGOS SWARM DAEMONS
===================

The autonomous processes that give Logos continuous life.

Daemons:
- dream_daemon: Memory consolidation (REM sleep analog)
- gardener: Edge pruning for hypergraph (to be added)

These run on the Hippocampus (Mac Mini) and maintain
system health while the Cortex (Mac Studio) sleeps.
